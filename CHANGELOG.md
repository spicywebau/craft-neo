> {warning} If you're updating from a Neo version prior to 2.8.16, you're running a multi-site Craft install, and you've ever changed your Neo fields' propagation methods, run the `php craft neo/fields/reapply-propagation-method` command after updating to potentially fix a bug from prior to Neo 2.8.14 where changes to a field's propagation method weren't being applied to their blocks. If that command causes an error, run `php craft neo/fields/reapply-propagation-method --by-block-structure` instead (be aware that this may create many jobs in the queue).

### Added
- Added the `groupId` column to the `neoblocktypes` table
- Added the `getGroup()` method to the `BlockType` model
- Added the `getGroupById()` method to the `BlockTypes` service

- Added the `php craft neo/fields/reapply-propagation-method` command with options `--field-id=<your comma-separated Neo field IDs here>` and `--by-block-structure`

- Fixed a bug that occurred when using `craft.neo.blocks()`, where trying to set the Neo block query's `owner` parameter to an owner element using a criteria array would cause the `owner` parameter to be ignored

## 2.9.2 - 2021-03-09

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug with Neo 2.9.1 where the max levels warning would display in some cases where it shouldn't display

## 2.9.1 - 2021-03-09

> {warning} As part of the changes to Neo 2.8 to support Craft 3.5's new field layout designer, it's no longer possible to save blank tabs in Neo block types' field layouts.  Existing blank tabs should be retained when upgrading to Craft 3.5 and Neo 2.8, but they will be lost if they're still blank next time the field is saved.  It's recommended to place a UI element in any blank tabs that should be kept.

> {note} ~This update contains a schema update which could potentially break the structure of the neo blocks. Make sure to backup your database and do the update locally first as it includes migration of all neo blocks. If the structure is indeed broken, re-saving the page should resolve it. See #336. I'm currently looking into this issue so it's best to wait at version v2.6.x for now.~
>
> The latest release v2.7.9+ has changes to the migration file + fixes the issue when updating from craft at 3.3 and lower #326 (this is most likely the cause of out of order/missing blocks).
