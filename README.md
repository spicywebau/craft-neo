# Neo
#### A Matrix-like field type with block hierarchy

Neo is a [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com) field type that builds upon the concept of the [Matrix field type](https://craftcms.com/features/matrix) with a number of very useful features. Neo has been carefully crafted (pun intended) to ensure it matches the look and feel of Craft.

### Allow blocks to contain children

Let block types have the ability to contain child block types. You can filter what blocks are allowed within others, as well as set whether a block type can only be a child of another.

### Group block buttons

Sometimes you end up with many block types. Adding groups allows you to organise your block types into drop down menus.

### Set minimum and maximum blocks by type

Neo has the ability to set minimum and maximum counts on individual block types, either throughout a Neo field, or under one parent block or at the top level.

### Copy, paste and clone blocks

A copied block can be pasted anywhere within its Neo field that allows that block type to exist, including on a different entry. Blocks are copied and pasted with their descendants.
