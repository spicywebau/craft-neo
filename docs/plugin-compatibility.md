- [Super Table](https://github.com/verbb/super-table)
- [Typed Link Field](https://github.com/sebastian-lenz/craft-linkfield)

The following is a list of plugins that could conflict with Neo in some way.  If you know of a plugin that could conflict with Neo that isn't listed here, please let us know by [submitting an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/spicywebau/craft-neo/issues/new) so we can investigate the issue and resolve it if possible.

- [Preparse Field](https://github.com/aelvan/Preparse-Field-Craft) -- may cause issues with Neo blocks disappearing on save

The above list doesn't include plugins that Neo doesn't support but that don't conflict with Neo's functionality.  If you'd like a plugin to be supported by Neo, please [submit an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/spicywebau/craft-neo/issues/new).
