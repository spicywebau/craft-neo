# Installation

The plugin can be installed either through the [Plugin Store](https://plugins.craftcms.com/) or through [Composer](https://packagist.org/).

### Plugin Store
Open the control panel for your website. Navigate to **Settings &rarr; Plugins** and search for **Neo**. Click **Install**.

### Composer
Run the following command in the root directory of your Craft project:
```
composer require spicyweb/craft-neo
```


## Requirements

### Craft version
Neo requires Craft CMS 3.7.12 or later.

### PHP version
Neo has the same PHP version requirement as Craft CMS 3.7.12: PHP 7.2.5 or later.

### Browser support
Neo officially supports the same browsers and versions that Craft CMS supports:

- Firefox 67+
- Chrome 63+
- Safari 11.1+
- Edge 79+

While Neo may work on browsers outside of those listed, the above list is what Neo explicitly supports. The best option is to use an up-to-date major browser.
